# Introduction

A few scholars have focussed on her theological development of the appearance of Radha with Krishna, amongst whom Miller (1975) and
Hardy (1983) provide the best analyses from this perspective. Both, however, were
unable to delineate the exact process of her deification, as they lacked access to the
literature of one particular sect in India: the Nimbārka Sampradāya.

In order for these scholars to integrate the Nimbārka Sampradāya within their
treatments of Rādhā, they would have had to initiate a completely new
investigation into this subject, for not only were the available primary and
secondary sources scant, but, in addition, testimony from other traditions has
tended to lessen the importance of Nimbārkī activity.

-----


When Indologists first investigated Vaiṣṇavism, they were confronted by the
dynamic and ever-present Gauḍīya tradition in Bengal and the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition
of the south. This had a conditioning effect, as both these sects were characterised
by expansive textual traditions, strong hierarchies, vast infrastructure and
buildings, and learned practitioners and scholars. Other traditions and personages
who did not fit these criteria were almost inevitably consigned to the peripheries of
surveys, doxographies and catalogues, and their fringe position would have been
confirmed due to the sectarian bias of the various informants of early Indologists.
However, in 1883, F. S. Growse, Magistrate and Collector of Bulandshahr,
produced a local history entitled ‘Mathurā: a District Memoir’. His approach
adopted an almost empirical methodology when approaching the history of the
various places he visited, allotting equal importance to both scriptural and
informant testimony before arriving at his own conclusions. About the Nimbārka
tradition, he comments:

```
[Nimbārka’s] special tenets are little known; for, unlike the other Sampradāyas, his
followers (so far as can be ascertained) have no special literature of their own, either in
Sanskrit or in Hindi…Most of the solitary ascetics who have their little hermitages in the
different sacred groves, with which the district abounds, belong to the Nimbārka
persuasion (Growse 1883:194-195)
```

-----


```
The one [hermit] who has a cell in Kokilaban assured me that the distinctive doctrines of
his sect were not absolutely unwritten (as is ordinarily supposed) but are comprised in ten
Sanskrit couplets that form the basis of a commentary in as many thousands (Growse
1883:195).
```

It seems that he was referring to the Vedāntakāmadhenudaśaślokī (Daśaślokī) of
Nimbārka and its earliest commentary, the Vedāntaratnamañjūṣā of Puruṣottama,
his third successor. So, on the other hand, it is apparent from Growse’s account that
there were some members of the sect who appeared to be well aquainted with the
tradition and others who were ambivalent.


conventions of renunciation nonetheless located them firmly outside the purview of
the well supported Smārta, Śrīvaiṣṇava and other traditions. This resulted in Hindu
contemporaries, who are retrospectively regarded as having been fully aware of the
various groups in existence, not actually being conscious of the activity of these
comparatively minor communities and therefore unable to include them in their
writings.
This fact, in addition to Growse’s observations, defines the Nimbārkīs in terms
categorically different to those of other sampradāyas. The Nimbārka tradition did
not possess any grandiose buildings in Vṛndāvana at the time of Growse’s writing,
but it did possess many āśramas and smaller hermitages both within Vṛndāvana
and around the rest of Vraja (Growse 1883:194). In comparison to the Gauḍīyas,
the Śrī Sampradāya or the Puṣṭimārga, the textual tradition of the Nimbārka
Sampradāya is meagre, but it does exist. Whereas in other Hindu traditions
initiated followers are informed about their tenets, scriptures, clerical hierarchy and
other such factors, those of the Nimbārka tradition seem uncertain regarding the
historical and institutional details of their sect’s background. This veil of obscurity
must have been discouraging to early scholars, especially in the light of the
seeming inconsequentiality of the tradition in the wider Hindu landscape of India.

-----

For very different reasons, adherents of other traditions in India exhibit an apparent
ambivalence with regard to the Nimbārka Sampradāya, with the majority
maintaining borderline, and in some cases outright, animosity towards the tradition
(see section 7.2.1). These traditions do not even name the Nimbārka Sampradāya in
	
  
	
works which deal with the sampradāya’s tenets: rather, it is left up to readers to
make the connection, which adds another layer of complexity to the task of
investigating the Nimbārka Sampradāya; even Bose (1943) in her treatment of the
tradition’s primary source material chose to evade.


----

Currently the growth of the number of scholars examining the bhakti movement
and especially its renaissance in Vraja around the 16th century means that this area
of studies is receiving the critical analysis it deserves (such as Hare 2011, Hawley
2012 and 2013, Horstmann 1999 and 2006, Jones 1980 and Pauwels 1996, 2008,
2009 and 2010). Whilst every other tradition that had a presence in that region
possessed a settled chronology on the basis of which theories about their
development might be investigated in order to form a clearer picture of the
devotional landscape, Nimbārka and his tradition remains even less studied than,
say, Harirāma Vyāsa, the understanding of whom has benefitted from the laudable
efforts of Pauwels (1996). Clémentin-Ojha is the only scholar to have carried out
detailed investigations into the post-16th century Nimbārka Sampradāya, and her
research focusing on the religious politics surrounding the court of King Sawai Jai
Singh II of Jaipur (Clémentin-Ojha 1999 & 2011) has served only to reinforce the
fact that the analysis of just a single manuscript of this tradition can reveal valuable
information about a specific period.
This study is the first analysis of the primary sources of the early Nimbārka
Sampradāya with regards to the development of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. A cursory survey of
the Nimbārka tradition reveals that whilst currently it is not, or perhaps has never
	
  
been, a popular movement, it has been influential in many spheres of Indian
history. Aside from its contributions to literature, art, music, politics, ritual,
philosophy and theology, its most important legacy to the religious traditions of
India is that both Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are revealed and justified scripturally to be the
sole occupiers of the Vedāntic ontological category of Parabrahman. This
innovation, it could be claimed, not only projected Rādhā from being the love-lorn
damsel of poetry connoiseurs to becoming part of Brahman for Vedānta
theologians, but also re-elevated Kṛṣṇa to superiority over Viṣṇu/Nārāyaṇa in the
traditional religion. All other Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa traditions can be held to be
philosophical heirs of the Nimbārka Sampradāya, but this insight has not been
factored into many studies on Vaiṣṇava developmental studies.


----

that a study focussed on the Nimbārka Sampradāya can make a
sizeable contribution to our understanding of pre-modern Hinduism.


----

It will then be possible to understand that the Nimbārkī
leaders of this era utilised innovative techniques which ensured that their theology
became the foundation upon which all later developments of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa
devotion could be anchored.

----

The chronological and theological strands lead to a
coherent conclusion, namely that Nimbārka’s original elevation of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa to
	
  
Parabrahman is the source of all later Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa themed devotionalism in
Vaiṣṇavism, which when factored into the wider Vaiṣṇava study discourse will
certainly enhance the understanding of the rise of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa to prominence in a
religious tradition where Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa were the major focus of devotions.

----

With regards to
Nimbārka and his sect, such investigations have mostly utilised testimony from
those outside the sampradāya as their basis, without examination of the literature
of the tradition itself.

----

The title of this section, as I shall seek to demonstrate, is a misnomer, since
Vedāntic devotion to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa as the supreme Brahman is directly attributable
to Nimbārka

----

hough Kṛṣṇa was mentioned in various early scriptures, he never
occupied the ontological position of Parabrahman in Vedānta until the theology of
Nimbārka, who simultaneously introduced not only Kṛṣṇa but also Rādhā to that
category. Before Nimbārka, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa occupied a position in the aesthetic
realm as the epitome of sexual love beyond regulative social norms, a position
which regularly manifested itself in Prakrit and Sanskrit poetry, but their
relationship is never articulated in religious texts as being a mode of love shared
between the supreme divinity and his consort. Indeed, texts such as the
Bhāgavatapurāṇa, whose sole focus is the mythological status of Kṛṣṇa, actively
deny Rādhā’s existence.
