Nimbarks svabhavika bedha abedha and Bhaskaracharyas - aupadhika bedha abedha and poles apart my friend. Its more different than the same. Have you read anything on aupadhika bedha abedha ?

aupadhika means non permanent
svabhavika means original or natural

I mentioned him being a vaishnav to help us understand the major difference of them, cause Bhaskar Acharya leans more towards advaita vada. Here I will type it out in full:

Sri Nimbark acharya ji is a vaishnava therefor bhakti and a loving relationship with Bhagavaan is the most important.
So keeping this in mind, here are some of the major aspects of Sri Bhaskar acharyas jis aupadhika bedha abedha doctrine:

- Absolute reality is ONE. Only conditional state its one and simultaneously different.
- Brahman is non different to the soul. They are one.
- Difference and non difference only exist due the jivas ignorance and is temporarily real while covered in ignorance.
- Oneness is more important than difference, instead of equal importance.
- Moksha only means merging into Brahman.
- Believes that a mixture of gyaan, karma and dhyaan leads to moksha. But emphasises a lot on karma yoga and has different ideas with the purpose of karma yoga, like karma yoga can never be given up at any point in time.
- Makes no mention of importance to surrender to Guru
- Meditation should only be done on Nirguna Brahman or that I am Brahman. He reputes the idea to meditate on the form of Brahman or even having a loving relationship with God.
- Does not believe in grace of God.
