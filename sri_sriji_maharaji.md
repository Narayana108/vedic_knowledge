# SHRI SHRIJI MAHARAJ

`Jagat Guru Shri Radha Sarveshvar Sharan Devacharya` - `Shri Shriji Maharaj` , the previous acharya of Nimbarkacharya Peeth, Salemabad, was born to Shri Ramnathji Sharma Goud Indoria and Srimathi Swarnalata, on the auspicious day of 1st Vaishaka Sukhla , Friday in Vikram Samvat year of 1986 i.e. 10th May ,1921 at Salemabad . At the tender age of 11 years, you had been consecrated as the heir to the Nimbarkacharya peeth by Shri Nimbarkacharya Shri Balakrishna Sharan Devacharya and obtaining the Vaishnava Deeksha. At the young age of 20, consequent to the passing away of the acharya, he had ascended to the Acharya of Nimbarkacharya peeth on the 5th of June 1943. Till the year 1948 he was under the tutelage of `Shri Mahant Dhananjay Kathia Baba Maharaj` learning Vedanta & Grammar.

At the tender age of 14, he had been bestowed with the leadership of the Akhil Bharatiya Sadhu Sammelan at Kurukshetra. At the sammelan , Jagatguru Shankaracharya and Puri Peetadhishvar were also present. Seeing the young acharya holding the Chairmanship of the organization, the Jagat Guru Shankaracharya said “ We are very proud to see the young Shri Nimbarkacharya as the Chairman of this august gathering. People -”…. do not fret about his tender age- The Tulsi Leaf and the Shaligram idol may be small or large , but does not make a difference in their importance”

In this way, since the age of 14 itself he has been rendering service to Shri Sarveshvar Prabhu. You have traveled extensively in India. You have undertaken to organize and conduct various religious activities at the Mahakumbh festival at Nashik, Ujjain, Vrindavan, Prayag and Haridwar. Here Non-Stop kirtan, Service to saints, Ras-Lila, Preaching’s etc, are carried out with religious fervor at the NIMBARK NAGAR especially constructed for the purpose , thus ensuring the spread and rejuvenate the Vaishnava Sampraday.

In 1970 , along with over three thousand devotees you had undertaken the Shri Vraj Chourasi Kos Yatra. This Yatra started and ended at Vanshi Vat in Vrindavan . The devotees who were fortunate to be part of the yatra state that neither in the past nor in the future would one be able to witness such a massive, spontaneous participation, flow of Bhakti ras and devotion of the village folk all along the route.

In 1976 , a massive Akhil Bharatiya Sanatana Conference was conducted at the Nimbarkacharya Peeth which is considered very significant. A similar conference was conducted 19 years later to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Shri Shriji Maharaj ascending to the Acharya of the Peeth.

Till the year 1992, during his travel all over the country not only was the spread of Vaishnava Sampradaya evident but also saw the construction of many Religious Centers and Temples. The gigantic Madanganj Temple of Shri Radha Sarveshvar, Shri Nimbark kot at Ajmer, Bhagawan Shri Nimbark Tapas (Rigorous Prayers) site at Nimbgram was developed and a new Temple of RadhakrishnaVihariji was constructed in addition to renovating the ancient temple there, a new Temple at Sri Pushkaraj , Construction of a new temple at the revered site of the birth of Bhagwan Shri Nimbarkacharya at Moongi-Paitan , presently in Maharashtra, Buildings for both the Vidyalayas of the Acharyapeeth, Building for conducting satsang, RadhaMadhav Cow– farm, Site for conducting Yagnyas (Rites) , Dispensary , Shri Sarveshvar Park, Cottage for the Acharya, Hostel for students of the Vidyalayas , Shri Hanuman Mandir, Guest House, are amongst the few.

In the field of Education , Shri Sarveshvar Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Sri Nimbark Darshan Vidyalaya and Ved Vidyalaya were established and run by the Acharya Peeth , from where students enter various fields of Religion, Service and Education successfully and are in very high positions. The entire cost of Food, Clothing , Boarding and Books of the students is borne by the Acharya Peeth.

In the field of dissemination of literature your influence has been considerable . By establishing the Shri Sarveshvar Press and publishing of periodicals , the common man / devotee has now access to the Sampraday, mode of worship , Mantras and Literary pieces. Sri Sriji Maharaj is an erudite scholar with mastery over Sanskrit, Hindi , Brajbhasha , Bangla and Hindu religion . He also has in depth knowledge of Ayurveda and Musicology.

In this manner , millions of devotees have been blessed by your Diksha, Upadesh, Writings and Teachings. There is no doubt that this Acharya Peeth has seen unparalleled multi disciplinary growth. In spite of indifferent health your commitment to the sampraday , your piety, simple lifestyle and your blessings to one and all is a magnificent symbol to all devotees. Many devotees have their questions and doubts answered and now lead a successful pious life.

In this Kali-Yug as stated in the Granths , it is only the GURU who can lead us devotees out of the cycle of Birth and Death , the world of duality . It is only by complete faith in the GURU, observing the systems of the Sampraday, Total Surrender, Bhakti, Sat-Sang (being in the company of pious souls) and Nama– Smaran (Repetition of the Lords Name) that devotees can cross this ocean—known as life.
