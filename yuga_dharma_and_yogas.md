# Yuga Dharma and Yoga’s

All the different yoga's are interlinked and inseparable, as by performing one yoga, one or more yoga’s may be performed directly or indirectly. And when one reaches the higher stages of yoga, it all turns into bhakti though externally people might see it as different. How can it all be Bhakti ? First we need to understand: *Hari Om Tat Sat* - There is nothing in existence other than Lord Hari. We are viewing Him and exploring Him alone in different forms and aspects. 

But there is His higher and lower forms, when we know His higher forms such as Krishna one automatically knows everything. And the only way to know and understand Krishna in full, is through bhakti.

*The Supreme Lord said: Now listen, O Arjun, how, with the mind attached exclusively to me, and surrendering to me through the practice of bhakti yog, you can know me completely, free from doubt.
I shall now reveal unto you fully this knowledge and wisdom, knowing which nothing else remains to be known in this world.
Amongst thousands of persons, hardly one strives for perfection; and amongst those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows me in truth.* - Bhagavad Gita 7.1 - 7.3

*Only by loving devotion to me does one come to know who I am in truth. Then, having come to know me, my devotee enters into full consciousness of me.* - Bhagavad Gita 18.55

Why do I say when one reaches the higher stages of yoga everything is bhakti? Because when one studies shastra, people may think that its Gyaan yoga. But anything becomes Bhakti Yoga as soon as it is connected to Bhagavaan. For example: Vedanta is there to describe Bhagavaan, Dhyaan is there to meditate on Bhagavaan, Paramatma and even meditating on the chakras and raising Kundalini is also Bhakti as Kundalini is Shakti ! But even different Dyaan techniques such as scanning the body, observing the mind and sensations, focusing on the breath can also be bhakti as its being used to rewaken our Citt (internal embedded all knowing knowledge from the atma) by entering into different levels of samadhi. This also applies for kriya, pranayama, mudra, asana ,etc.

“One must know the meaning of the word jñāna in its appropriate context. If jñāna was not needed for bhakti, then Kṛṣṇa’s instruction to Uddhava would be meaningless: “Being endowed with jñāna and vijñāna, worship Me with bhakti-bhāva”—jñāna-vijñāna-sampanno bhaja māṁ bhakti-bhāvataḥ (SB 11.19.5). 
It is a fact that bhakti can grant all jñāna, but to execute bhakti, one needs jñāna.” - Satya Narayana Das Babaji

Ref: [Is studying scriptures Bhakti or Gyaan?](https://www.jiva.org/studying-sastra-jnana-or-bhakti/)

We have different samskars therefore we have different attractions to different yoga's, and we progress better in some yogas and less in other yoga's. So we should follow and trust the samskars that we have, as there are many different ways of realizing the Absolute Truth. And one cannot practise all the yogas. So one should seek out a bonafide spiritual master that aligns with our samskars and preferences, if you are the fortunate few that is able to perform different types of yoga’s. 

But it is clearly stated in the Vedic Literature that Bhakti/Japa Yoga is the most effective and recommended process for self and God realization in Kali Yuga, that's why japa is called the Yuga Dharma. 


# Shastra:
#### Here is some evidence from the Vedic Scriptures:

- **Kali Santrana Upanishad.** (The upanisad which helps you to clear all obstacles in Kali Yuga)

hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare
hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare

iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanaṁ
nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate

Meaning: *After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method more sublime for this age than the chanting of these sixteen names which will remove all inauspiciousness and obstacles.*


- **Manu Smriti**

*An offering, consisting of muttered prayers, is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice performed according to the rules (of the Veda); a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) a thousand times.*

*The four Pakayagnas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules (of the Veda) are all together not equal in value to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers.*

*But, undoubtedly, a Brahmana reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only; (whether) he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he who befriends (all creatures) is declared (to be) a (true) Brahmana.*


- **KulArnava Tantram**

Iswara Uvacha:
Japa Yajnath Paro Yajno NAparohastiha Kaschana ||
Tasmajjapen DharmArthaKAmaMokshanscha SAdhayeth ||

Meaning:
*In this world there is no Yajna which is superior to Japa Yajna,hence one should attain Dharma,Artha,Kama & Moksha through Japa.*

KulArnava Tantram,Chapter 15,Verse 3.


- **Brihan-naradiya Purana**

harer nama harer nama, harer namaiva kevalam;
kalau nasty eva nasty eva, nasty eva gatir anyatha.

*For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali which is full of quarrel and hypocrisy, there is  no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative to the Holy Name, the Holy  Name, the Holy Name of the Lord.* - 38.126


- **Sri Caitanya-caritamrta**

*In this Age of Kali, the Holy Name of the Lord, the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, is the  incarnation of Lord Krishna.  Simply by chanting the Holy Name, one associates with the  Lord directly.  Anyone who does this is certainly delivered.* - Adi-lila 17.22-26

*Religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation are known as the four goals of life, but before love of Godhead, the fifth and highest goal, these appear as insignificant as straw in the street.* - Ādi 7.84

*The conclusion of all revealed scriptures is that one should awaken his dormant love of Godhead. You are greatly fortunate to have already done so.* - Ādi 7.87

*When one actually develops love of Godhead, he naturally sometimes cries, sometimes laughs, sometimes chants and sometimes runs here and there just like a madman.* - Ādi 7.88


- **Caitanya Bhagavan**
 
*Therefore the essence of all religious principles in the Age of Kali is the sacrifice of  chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra...* - Adi-khanda 14.1.39


- **Bhagavad Gita** 
 
*Of sacrifices I am the chanting of My Holy Names.* - 10.52

*Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.*- 15.19

*This is the most conﬁdential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.*- 15.20

*And of all yogīs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.* - 6.42


- **Srimad Bhagavatam**

*People in Satya-yuga are peaceful, nonenvious, friendly to every creature and steady in all situations. They worship the Supreme Personality by austere meditation and by internal and external sense control....
In Tretā-yuga, those members of human society who are fixed in religiosity and are sincerely interested in achieving the Absolute Truth worship Lord Hari, who contains within Himself all the demigods. The Lord is worshiped by the rituals of sacrifice taught in the three Vedas....
In Dvāpara-yuga men who desire to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer, worship Him in the mood of honoring a great king, following the prescriptions of both the Vedas and tantras....
Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value of this Age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of saṅkīrtana [chanting together]*. - 11.5.22,36

puṁsāṁ kali-kṛtān doṣān
dravya-deśātma-sambhavān
sarvān harati citta-stho
bhagavān puruṣottamaḥ

*In the Kali-yuga, objects, places and even individual personalities are all polluted. The almighty Personality of Godhead, however, can remove all such contamination from the life of one who fixes the Lord within his mind. If a person hears about, glorifies, meditates upon, worships or simply offers great respect to the Supreme Lord, who is situated within the heart, the Lord will remove from his mind the contamination accumulated during many thousands of lifetimes.... Whatever result was obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Viṣṇu, in Tretā-yuga by performing sacrifices, and in Dvāpara-yuga by serving the Lord’s lotus feet can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by chanting [Hari].* - 12.3.45

kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet

*My dear King, although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.* - 12.3.51

kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt

*Whatever result was obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Viṣṇu, in Tretā-yuga by performing sacrifices, and in Dvāpara-yuga by serving the Lord’s lotus feet can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.* - 12.3.52


- **Vishnu Purana**

dhyayan krte yajan yajnais
tretayam dvapare 'rcayan
yad apnoti tad apnoti
kalau sankirtya kesavam

*The fruit of penance, of continence, of silent prayer, and the like, practised in the Krita age for ten years, in the Treta for one year, in the Dwápara for a month, is obtained in the Kali age in a day and night: therefore did I exclaim "Excellent, excellent, is the Kali age!" That reward which a man obtains in the Krita by abstract meditation, in the Treta by sacrifice, in the Dwápara by adoration, he receives in the Kali by merely reciting the name of Keshava.*


- **Padma Purana**

dvapariyair janair visnuh
pancaratrais tu kevalaih
kalau tu nama-matrena
pujyate bhagavan harih
 
*Whatever is achieved by meditation in Satya-yuga, by the performance of yajna in  Treta-yuga or by the worship of Krishna's lotus feet in Dvapara-yuga is obtained very  easily in the Age of Kali simply by chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.* - Uttara-khanda 72.25


# Sadhu’s:
#### Here are some statements from fully self realized souls and avatars.

- **Swami Shivananda**
  - Japa Japa Japa the only way to wipe out your all sufferings and sins.
  - In this Iron Age, Japa Yoga is an easy way for attaining God-realisation

[japa-yoga-swami-sivandanda](https://gurudevsivananda.blogspot.com/2010/11/japa-yoga-by-gurudev-swami-sivananda.html)


- **Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj**

*It is impossible to attain God by practicing austerities, yoga, japa or by jnana and renunciation. He can only be attained by exclusive devotion.*


- **SwamiNarayan (Avatar)**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminarayan)

"While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered Astanga yoga (eightfold yoga) in a span of nine months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi."

^ That happend before he was 18, But still he only taught Japa and Bhakti even to his most advanced disciples and they all reached Maha Samadi and Prem(Pure love of Godhead).

*This magnificent gift
is the Swaminarayan mahamantra
(supreme mantra) and was bestowed
unto mankind about 213 years ago
by Bhagwan Swaminarayan.
In explaining the glory of the Swaminarayan mahamantra,
Gunatitanand Swami said, “All malicious desires, bad habits,
and addictions will be eradicated. Any sins or mistakes that
have been committed, knowingly or unknowingly, will be
washed away. Even if someone is bitten by a venomous snake,
the poison is incapable of causing any harm. Such is the
strength of the supreme Swaminarayan mahamantra.”*
(Swami Ni Vaato – P.1, V.153)


- **Rama Krishna**

*However it would be far more profitable if one chants the name of God with
faith, love and longing. Sri Ramakrishna emphasizes intense yearning:
Goswami: "Sir, the chanting of God's name is enough. The scriptures
emphasize the sanctity of God's name for the Kaliyuga."
Master: "Yes, there is no doubt about the sanctity of God's name. But can a
mere name achieve anything, without the yearning love of the devotee behind it?
One should feel great restlessness of soul for the vision of God. Suppose a man
repeats the name of God mechanically, while his mind is absorbed in `lust and gold',
can he achieve anything?
"Therefore I say, chant the name of God, and with it pray to Him that you
may have love for Him. Pray to God that your attachment to such transitory things
as wealth, name, and creature comforts may become less and less every day."
The scriptures and saints tell us that there is a tremendous joy in God's name,
for God is of the nature of Bliss; He is Satchidananda. A beginner, however, does not
experience any joy. On the contrary he may feel only dryness. It is not the fault of
God's name. The fault lies in the mind of the devotee. As long as the mind has not
turned away from worldly delights it is not possible to taste divine bliss. One must
try to develop discrimination and dispassion for the world. Only when the mind is
purified of worldly dross does one begin to taste the joy of divine name. One must
pray to God with yearning for getting rid of desires and for getting delight in His
name:
Devotee: "How can I take delight in God's name?"
Master: "Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name.
He will certainly fulfil your heart's desire."*


- **Swami Vivekananda**

*Books and learning, Yoga and meditation and illumination — all are but dust compared with love.*


- **Tulsi Das**

*The age of Kali is a store house of impurities and vices but it has many virtues too. Final emancipation is possible in the Kali age without any exertion. Moreover, the same goal which is reached through worship of God, performance of sacrifices or the practice of Yoga in the Satyayuga and in the Treta and Dwapara yuga, men are able to attain through the name of Sri Hari in the Kali age. No other age can compare with the Kali age provided a man has faith (in its virtue); for in this age one can easily cross the ocean of transmigration simply by singing Sri Ram's holy praises.*
https://tulsidasa.blogspot.com/2016/06/kali-yuga.html


- **Guru Nanak**

*With my hands I do God's work; with my tongue I sing God's Glorious Praises.
With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master.
It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
With your eyes, behold the Blessed Vision of the Saints.
Record the Immortal Lord God within your mind.
Listen to the Kirtan of God's Praises, at the Feet of the Holy.
Your fears of birth and death shall depart.
Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within your heart.
Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall be redeemed.*
— Guru Granth Sahib, page 189

- **Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabu (Avatar)**
[Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitanya_Mahaprabhu)

When Sri Krisnha Chaitanya was 17 He mastered Gyaan, Shastra, Sanskrit Grammer and Rules and Logic and started teaching His students the same skills He mastered. From this age onwards his name and fame spread and many great scholars came to debate him. There was one scholar who was even blessed by Sri Sarawati Devi, that She would speak through him, thus enabling the scholar to never even make a slight fault in any of his arguements and statements. The scholar started debating with Sri Krisha Chaitanya, and Sri Krishna Chaitanya started poiting out flaws in his grammer and conclusions. Bewilderd by this, the scholar prayed to Sarawati  Devi to ask what fault he had commited that she withdrew Her blessings. Saraswati Devi then appeared in his dreams and answered him saying that she got shy when she saw Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabu as that is Her worshipable Lord, Sri Krishna Bhagavaan, and thus revealed to him Sri Krishna Caitaynas true identity. The next day he approached Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabu, falling flat at His lotus feet apologizing and glorifying Him. Sri Krishna Chaitanya quickly become famous as the top scholor in West Bengal and India by debating and defeating dozens of the top schoalars from all over Bharat(India).

At the age of 24, He took up the order of Sannyasa and left his wife and home town. All of his associates where shocked to see his change of mood from a scholar to a devotee. From this day onwards Chaitanya Mahaprabu gave up studying and debating and dedicated His life to the spreading of the Holy Names. He was experiencing such deep ecstacies that He appeared like a mad man, Jumping, Rolling, Crying, Lauging, Being completly unaware of His actions and surroundings, etc. These are some of the symptom of Love of Godhead !

Once while passing through Benares a few sannyasi's saw Him, and thought that it was a great shame to see a sannyasi like this, they thought he is a great fool and a sentimentilist, wasting his time dancing and chanting and not engaging in studying the Vedas. Not knowing that He is actually the Supreme Personility of Godhead Himself or atleast that He is famous great linguist and Vedanta scholar. At the request of one of Sri Krsnas Chaitanya Mahaprabus disciple, Lord Chaitanya for the first time accepted their invatation and joined the sannyasi's at a gathering. There the sannyasi's confronted Him asking Him why is not engaged like the other Sannyasis sitting and studing the Vedas and what is this chanting, dancing, crying, lauging and other funny activities that He is doing ? By Sri Krishna Chaitanyas causeless mercy He illumined all the sannyasi's present about the real teachings and essence of the Veda's, being mind blown and extremly pleased with Chaitanyas presentation they all become His followers and started chanting and dancing like mad men as well !

Sri Ramanuja Acarja, Nimbark Acarya, Vallabha Acharya, Madhav Acarya, etc all recommend and bhakti and japa as the most effective yoga for Kali Yuga as well As this is all the teachings in the Vedic scriptures.
