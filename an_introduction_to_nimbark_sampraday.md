# An introduction to Nimbark Sampraday

## History
The Nimbark sampraday is one of the oldest existing sampradays. The Sampraday originates from Śrī Hansa Bhagavān to Sri Sankadi bhagwan (one of the Four Kumaras), who passed it to Sri Narada Muni; and then on to Sri Nimbarka Acharya ji. Nimbark Acarayaji was born at the end of dwarpa yuga making the sampraday more than 5000 years old.

## Philosophy
Sri Nimbark Acaryaji is the sampraday acharya and established the siddhanta known as `Dvaita Advaita` also known as `Bhedabheda`, `Dualistic Non-Dualism`. The jiva is simultaneously one and different to Ishvara and prakriti.

The sampraday has exclusive worship to Radha Krisha in Vrindavan only.  There is no superiority between Radha and Krishna, both are Bhagavaan(God). They simultaneously one and separate, dvaita advaita. Krishna is the praana of Radha, and Radha is the praana of Krishna. 

In the Nimbark sampraday Radha and Krishna are married and the worship of Radha and Krishna has been going on since the start of the sampraday.

## Practice/Sadhana
The Nimbark sampraday firmly believes that naam japa is the best method to achieve moksha. This is the main practice. 

 They chant the `Yugal maha mantra` or `Radha Krishna maha mantra`: 
 
*Radhe Krishna Radhe Krishna 
Krishna Krishna Radhe Radhe, 
Radhe Shyaam Radhe Shyaam 
Shyaam Shyaam Radhe Radhe*

This used to be a secret mantra in the sampraday, but it has now been wide spread and chanted by all.

 Sri Nimbark Acaryaji as well as Sri Hari Vyas Dev Acaryaji have also given very special importance to the name and worship of Radharani. Therefor you will find many Nimbarki's also chanting `Radhe Radhe` as well.

When the Nimbarki's perform dhyaan they meditate between their eye brows, focused on their bindi meditating on Radha Krishna, the yog pit (a mandala where Radha and Krishna and the sakhi's live) and or lila. 

The name, form, qualities and past times of Sri Sri Radha Krishna are seen to be non different from each other. So the Dhyaan, Naam Jaap and Maha Vani Gayaan(Chanting) is all the same.

## Moksha
A state of awareness of full identity with the divine couple Radha Krishna.

The type of moksha that they desire is to become the servants of Sri Yugal Sarkar(Radha Krishna) and to serve and reside with them in their eternal abode `Sri Vrindavan Dham`. 


## Saints
One of the most important Acarya's in the sampraday is `Sri Hari Vyas Deva acharyaji` who appeared some where around the 13th or 14th century. He wrote the most confidential and revered book in the sampraday called `Maha Vani`, which deals with the intimate past times of Radha Krishna in Vrindavan Dham. But even to this day not all due to its confidential nature not all Nimbarki's read this book as one needs qualification to deal with its high subject matter or some of the Nimbark tyagi's choose to focus more on tapasya and naam jap.

Other very well know saints that come from the Nimbark sampraday is `Jayadev Goswami` who wrote `Gita Govinda` and `Swami Haridas` who founded the `Haridas sampraday`.

`Swami Sri Sribhatta`, the elder god-brother of Jayadeva composed the `Yugala Shataka` around 1294 CE for the Dhrupada style of musical presentation like Jayadeva, however unlike Jayadeva who composed his work in Sanskrit, Swami Shribhatta’s compositions are in Vraja Bhasha, a Hindi vernacular which was understood by all inhabitants of Vraja.

## Branches
Within the Nimbark sampraday their is a recent branch who's members receive the title `Kathia baba` in their name's. The saints were called Kathia Baba Maharaj by the common people due to the very unique thick wooden belt (kath) and white piece of cloth (coupin) worn by them which indicated their renunciation of all bodily pleasures.

The Kathia Baba's originally come from the Himalayas. This has influenced this branch with different practices of tapasya and a strong emphasis on vairagya. Though the chanting and worship Radha Krishna's name and form is still the centre of the branch and the tilak they wear is still the same. They normally have long dreadlocks and wear a thick wooden belt.

The first Kathia Baba that come down from the Himalayas and started spreading the Kathia baba branch was Sri Ram Das Kathia Baba(24 July 1800 - 8 February 1909).

## Tilak
The tilak of the Nimbark sampraday can mean two or more things:
1. The yellow line represents a mandir, and the bindi represents a murti of Sri Sri Radha Krishna.

2. The yellow outline represents Sriji's(Radha's) charan and the black bindi between the eye brows represents Krishna or the yog pit, a mandala where Radha and Krishna and the Sahecharis live. 

## Nimbark Tyagi's
The renunciations in nimbark sampraday are known as tyagi's. They do not wear safforn, they where a white dhoti with no pleat.

## Scripture's
I will write more on this as their are many different scriptures, but the main scriptures that are focused on are: `Bhagavad Gita`, `Srimad Bhagavatam`, `Bhakta Maal` and the rasiks recite `Maha Vani`.
 
## The end
The Nimbark sampraday though very large and open to all has always remained a hidden sampraday, since the time of Nimbark acarya ji up to the present day. It holds many secrets or untold stories that I feel need to be shared more as it can add so much more richness to the beautiful ocean of Sanatana Dharma.
