SRI NIMBARKACHARYA

Nimbarka’s philosophy is known as Dvaitadvaita , meaning existence of duality and non duality at the same time. All existence falls into three distinct groups namely Brahman (Ishvar) , Chit( Jiva) and Achit (Everything other than Chit—Prakriti (Nature))

This aspect can be better understood by the example of Waves on the ocean . They exist because of the ocean , yet are distinct entities. The water in the wave is the same as that in the ocean , that is to say a part of the ocean is in the wave. The wave has no separate existence other than in the ocean. Similarly , Chit and Achit have the essence of Brahman in them , yet are distinct and dependent on Brahman. Thus is explained the philosophy of Bheda-Bhed—Duality and Non-duality existing simultaneously.

“Difference” or “duality” refers to the separate but dependent existence of soul and matter (para-tantra-sattva-bhava), while “non-difference” or “non-duality” means that it is impossible for soul and matter to exist independently of God (svatantra-sattva-bhava). Nimbarka perceives the relation between Brahman, and souls (cit) and the universe (achit) as a relation of natural difference-non-difference (svabhavika-bhedabheda), as seen in the example earlier; so the souls and the universe, though nothing but Brahman (brahmatmaka), are different from Him because of their own peculiar natures and attributes. According to Nimbarka, Brahman (God), souls (cit) and matter or the universe (achit) are three equally real and co-eternal realities. Brahman is the Controller (niyantra), the soul is the enjoyer (bhokta), and the material universe is the object enjoyed (bhogya).

God
***

God as Radha Krishna, is the Supreme reality, free from all defects personifies goodness, Radha being the “Ahladini shakti ” or latent power of Shri Krishna . God is both the efficient and material cause of the universe. The world and the Jiva are only partial manifestations of this power. Brahman , Jiva and the Universe are not absolutely distinct and is a natural relationship of difference and non-difference (svabhavika-bhedabheda). If the universe were absolutely identical with God, with all of its imperfections, God would no longer be perfect. If, however, the universe were completely distinct from God, then God could not be its controller. The school of thought considers worship of Radhe Krishna, attended by thousands of gopi's, as our prime devotion - achieved by total Surrender (Prapatti)

Jiva
****
Just like a spider spins a web from itself, similarly Brahman has the Jiva & Universe out of Himself. Hence he is both the efficient and material cause. The relationship between Jiva and Brahman is one of formal difference and identity. Jiva is different if seen from the perspective of being a phenomenal aspect but identical when seen as a indivisible whole. Jiva is atomic (Anu) in size , in the form of knowledge and possessor of knowledge. It experiences pain and joy of the body and merges with the Brahman during the “Pralaya”.
Universe
According to Shri Nimbarkacharya, the Universe is not an Illusion , as it is a manifestation of Brahman. Sakti of Brahman is the material cause of the world. The three defining principles are :
1. Aprakriti: The material of the Divine form of the God not obtained from Prakriti.
2. Prakriti: The Universe with its triad of Gunas (Qualities) - Sattva , Rajas, Tamas
3. Kaal : The Time concept

Liberation from bondage
******************

Avidya, the ignorance of one’s true nature and relationship with God, is the cause of karma, and of attachment to the senses, body and matter. Only True knowledge brought about by complete surrender (Prapatti) can lead to release from this bondage. Bhakti as generated in the devotee by the grace of God leads to understanding the Jiva and lifting the veil of ignorance from the devotee. The individuality of the individual soul is maintained even in this liberated state wherein Brahman is revealed . Since the Jiva realizes itself to be a inseparable part of Brahman , it is released from the bondage. It is now full awareness and is liberated from the cycle of Birth and Death.

The basic tenets of the philosophy are thus :
*********************************

· The three categories Brahman, Jiva and Prakriti are beginingless. Brahman is independent and Jiva and Prakriti are subservient to Brahman.

· Jiva has three categories:
*********************

1. Baddha : (Sansari) - One who is totally immersed in this world of Maya.

2. Baddha Mukta : (Liberated from the Sansar) - One who has obtained liberation by Bhakti (Devotion)

3. Nitya Mukhta: ( Ever Liberated) - One who has never been in the grip of Maya

· Entire Universe is a part of Brahman and is in existence due to Prakriti. Hence harming any thing—living or Non-Living tantamount’s to harming Ishvar.

· For Nimbarka the highest object of worship is Krishna and His consort Radha, of the celestial Vrindavan. Devotion according to Nimbarka, consists in self-surrender.

The Supreme Being is absolutely free form all defects. He is full of all auspicious qualities. In Nimbarka, worship of Radha Krishna (Yugal Sarkar) gains pre-eminence. Historical studies confirm that it was after the advent of Shri Nimbarkacharya , that Radha and her glory has been portrayed as the eternal consort of Shri Krishna.
The Five Sadhanas

Karma (Ritual action)
Performed conscientiously in a proper spirit in tune with ones stage of life leading to knowledge as a means to salvation.

Vidya (Knowledge)
For persons who can spend countless hours in gaining knowledge, yet is still not an independent means.

Upasana or dhyana (meditation)
It is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non sentient. Third the meditation on Lord Himself.
Gurupasatti

Devotion and self surrender to guru.

Nimbarkacharya says in "Dasha Shloki" on the worship of the divine couple
ange tu vame vrishabhanujam muda, virajmanamanurupasaubhagam

sakhi sahasraih parisevitam sada, smarema devim sakaleshtakamadam

"To the left hand side of Goloka Bihari is the daughter of King Vrishabhanu, Sri Radha, who is as beautiful as the Lord and is worshipped by thousands of handmaidens. She fulfills the wishes of all. Sri Kishori is eternally remembered as Sri Ji. ."

Sri Nimbarkacharya wrote the following books:

· Vedanta Parijat Saurabh– Commentary on the Brahma Sutras;

· Sadachar Prakasha– Commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita

· Rahasya Shodasi- Sri Gopala Mantra explained

· Prapanna Kalpa Valli-Sri Mukunda Mantra explained

· Prapatti Chintamani– On Supreme surrender

· Pratah Smarana Stotram

· Dasa Shloki or Kama Dhenu– Ten Verses

· Savisesh Nirvisesh

· Sri Krishna Stavam


DAILY NIYAMAS
***********

The Sastras are very emphatic that mantras which are provided as diksha to the follower alone enables the devotee to cross this sansar sagar. It is the responsibility of the devotee to then follow the systems and rituals laid down. The basis of this sampraday is the “ashtayama service of Sri Radha Krishna” . Ashtayama meaning that which is spread over the entire 24 hours each day (ashtam—8 quarters). This includes the waking up , bathing, decorating , prayers, Mantra recitation , offering of all food prepared to the lord and then imbibing the same as “Prasad” , afternoon siesta of the lord, evening wake up , pooja aarthi after sankirtan and finally resting the lord for the night after supper. This is to be done with immense devotion , love and joy as if the entire time revolves around the devotion to the lord and hence leads to ultimate complete surrender to Radha Krishna by appropriating the events in life , good or bad to their feet. This way of life is easy, simple and being a part of daily life does not necessitate elaborate rituals or self denial.

The essential Niyams can be stated as:
****************************

1. Applying gopichandan at twelve designated points ,including the tilak, on the body based on the twelve names of Sri Krishna.
Forehead om keshavayah namaha
Belly om narayanaya namaha
Chest om madhavayah namaha
Neck om govindaya namaha
Right Belly om vishnave namaha
Right Arm om madhusudanaya namaha
Right Shoulder om trivikramaya namaha
Left Arm om vamanaya namaha
Left Belly om shridharaya namaha
Left Shoulder om hrishikesaya namaha
Upper Back om padmanabhaya namaha
Lower Back om damodaraya namaha


2. Permanently wearing a Tulsi mala (necklace) (Double Strand)

3. Reciting the diksha mantras using the mala daily.

4. Doing the ashtayama service for the installed Radhe Krishna idols daily. Here the” Bhav” (the thought /emotion) during the service is of paramount importance.

5. Imbibing the “teerth” ( holy water) obtained by the abhishek of the lord.

6. During Dhyana (Meditation) one should always keep one’s concentration on the image of Shri Yugal Kishore Radha Krishna.

7. Leading a very simple and religious life devoted to seva , bhakti and learning the scriptures.

8. Engaging in the thought of Sri Radhekrishna always and undertaking fast on Ekadashis(11th day after New Moon/ Full Moon)

9. Celebrating all festivals particularly, Janmashtami, Radhashtami and Guru Purnima.

DAILY MANTRAS
*************

1. While applying Gopi Chandan:

GopiChandana Papagna,Vishnudeha samudhbhava,Chakrankita Namastubhyam Dharanam Muktido Bhava

2. Gopala Gayatri Mantra:

Om Gopalaya Vidhmahe, GopiVallabhaya Dhimahi/ Tannah Krishnah Prachodayat/

3. Dasakshara– Gopala Mantra:

5. Shri Radha Chalisa

6. Shri Radha Kavacham

7. Shri Radha Kripa Kataksh Stotra

8. Shri Krishna Kripa Kataksh Stotra

9. Vedanta Dashashloki
Urdhva Pundra Vidhi for applying Tilak

Urdhva means upwards, Pundra means Lotus –herein lotus like feet

The Padma Purana says that those devotees on whose neck is the tulasi kanti mala and on whose shoulders there are the markings of conch and chakra and on whose body there are 12 tilak markings, they purify the entire universe immediately.

The tilak , representing a temple is made of Gopi-Chandana . The tilak represents the footprint of Krishna and starts at the bridge of the nose and continues as two vertical lines to the top of the forehead, curving away gently near the roots of the hair . Within these lines, between the eyebrows is a black dot which represents God as Radha and Krishna together.

The logo is of the Shri Nimbarkacharya peeth with the three symbols of Vaishnavism , Chakra , Tilak and Shankh (Conch shell) . The chakra here represents the Sudarshan Chakra , the most potent of weapons of Shri Krishna and whose avatar is Sudarshan Chakravatar Shri Nimbarkacharya. The tilak is the one all nimbarkis are to adorn on their foreheads as explained above. The conch shell , auspicious in its own right , is a means to spread the divine “sound”.

The Sri Garga Samhita explains the greatness of gopi-chandana as follows:

tasmac chata-gunam punyam
gopi-candanakam rajah
gopi-candanakam viddhi
vrndavana-rajah-samam

It is hundred times more sacred - this dust of Gopi-Chandana. Know that gopi-candana is equal to the dust of Vrndavana.
