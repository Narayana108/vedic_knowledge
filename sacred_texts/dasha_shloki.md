2. anadi maya pari yukta roopam, tvenam vidurvai bhagavatprasadat
    muktancha baddham kila baddhamuktam, prabheda bahulya mathapi bodhyam

It is not known since when “MAYA” has been after Jeev. The conjunction with MAYA, which is beginingless, is the reason why Jeev is unable to recognise the from of the PARAMATMA. When the Lord graces, then alone one can get rid of MAYA and obtain the knowledge of the Lord. Though Jeev is of many types, they can be classified mainly as one who is

    maya pradhan aadipadapravachyam , shuklabhibhedashcha sameapi tatra

Aprakrit- The Chit form of God etc. Prakrit= Prakriti – meaning Universe. Universe, its work and Time are all without awareness (Achit) . Maya  as Primary, unmanifested etc are also names of Universe. ; White, Blood and golden yellow coloured Sattvic , Rajasic and Tamasic qualities also belong to  Universe.

3- The inanimate objects are of three kinds 1* not derived by prakṛti 2* derived from prakṛti and 3* Time. In the thing derived by prakṛti, we have the ordinary material objects having the three colors,  viz. Red, white, dark.

   vyohanginam brahm param varenyam, dhyayem krishnam kamalekshanam harim

  One who is an ocean of good qualities but is not tainted by any fault of Prakriti and form part of the four Vyuhas (Divine forms) Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradhyumna and Aniruddha . One who is Lotus eyed, the saviour of devotees from sins and faults, the One who is worthy of service to be done unto, that Parabrahm ShriKrishna we meditate upon.

Beautiful and sweet like Shri Krishna, seated alongside on the left, served by thousands of sakhis, she (Shri Kishori Radha) who grants all the wishes, we meditate upon her.

6.  upasaniyaam nitram janayhi sada, prahannaye agyana tamo anuvratte
   sanandadhyir munibhisthoktam, shrinaradayakhila tatva sakshine
 
One should constantly dwell and meditate on this Yugal (Dual) form of Parabrahm – Shri Radhakrishna. Mere concentrating on them dissolves ignorance. Our Shri Nimabrkacharya’s foremost guru ShriSanakadi rishis had bestowed this very same knowledge to Gurudev Shri Narada.

6- This Parabrahman should be always worshipped uninterruptedly by men in order to be free from the darkness in the shape of ignorance, in which they are enveloped. So was Nārada who directely perceived the whole truth, taught by Sananda and others.

    brahmatma katvaditi vedavinmatam, triroopata apisrutisutra sadhita

Achit- Chit and visible is this Universe and is in the form of Brahm, as stated by the Saashtras. Since it is the essence of Brahm , it is also a reality (true). The trinity of Bhokta (Enjoyer) , Bhogya (That which is enjoyed) and the Inspiration (cause)  as stated in the Srutis and texts also are to be taken as a reality.

7- All thing having Brahman for their souls in accordance with the Śrutis and Smṛtis, the knowledge that (Brahman) is all i true. 
This is the doctrine of those who know rb Vedas, and at the sam time the three forms are true as deternined from the sacred precepts (smṛtis) and the Sūtras. 


8. nanya gatihi krishna paadaravindat, sandrishyate brahmashivadi vanditat
   bhaktechyo pattasuchintya vigrahad chintya shakteravi chintya sashayat

One whose extent of strength and meaning is unknowable, even then One who takes many Avatars due to the wishes of devotees. There is no other refuge other than the lotus feet of Shri Radhakrishna  for the grief ridden Jeevas  other than One who is deified by Brahma , Shiva and other Gods.

8- There appears no way to salvation except the lotus-like feet of Kṛṣṇa which are adored by Brahmadeva, Śiva and others. Kṛṣṇa, who at the desire of the devotee assumes a form easy of meditation and whise power is unthinkable and whose essence cannot be comprehended.

One who has the qualities of humility etc., the Lord graces only them. Because of this grace alone the Love specific bhakti of the One and only owner Shri Sarveshvar Prabhu is obtained. This bhakti alone is the exalted bhakti. Reciting names of the Lord, singing kirtans and conducting rituals is known as Apara Bhakti.

9- His grace extends itself to those who have a feeling of helplessness and other qualifications and by that grace is generated Bhakti consisting on special love for him, who has no superior lord. 
This Bhakti is of two kinds; the highest and that which leads to or is instrumental to it.
