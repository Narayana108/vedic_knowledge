## Dashasloki trnslated by Ramakrishna Bhandarkar on this book 👆

1. Jīva, or the individual soul, is knowledge dependent on Hari and is is a condition to be associated with or dissociated from, a body; is an atom; different in different bodies; and is a knower and numberless.

2. The individual soul has his form distorted by its contact with māyā or prakṛti, or the constituent principle with the three qualities which has no beginning. It's true nature becomes known by the grace of God. 

3. The inanimate objects are of three kinds 1* not derived by prakṛti 2* derived from prakṛti and 3* Time. In the thing derived by prakṛti, we have the ordinary material objects having the three colors,  viz. Red, white, dark. 

4. I meditate on the highest Brahman, viz. Kṛṣṇa who has eyes like a lotus, who naturally is free from all faults, is the store of all beneficient atributes, who has vyūhas for his parts, and who is adorwd by all. 

5. I reflect on the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu (Rādhikam),  who shines with correspuonding beauty on the left side (of Kṛṣṇa), is attended on by thousand of female friends, and who always conferes all desired objects. 

6. This Parabrahman should be always worshipped uninterruptedly by men in order to be free from the darkness in the shape of ignorance, in which they are enveloped. So was Nārada who directely perceived the whole truth, taught by Sananda and others. 

7. All thing having Brahman for their souls in accordance with the Śrutis and Smṛtis, the knowledge that (Brahman) is all i true. 

This is the doctrine of those who know rb Vedas, and at the sam time the three forms are true as deternined from the sacred precepts (smṛtis) and the Sūtras. 

8. There appears no way to salvation except the lotus-like feet of Kṛṣṇa which are adored by Brahmadeva, Śiva and others. Kṛṣṇa, who at the desire of the devotee assumes a form easy of meditation and whise power is unthinkable and whose essence cannot be comprehended. 

9. His grace extends itself to those who have a feeling of helplessness and other qualifications and by that grace is generated Bhakti consisting on special love for him, who has no superior lord. 
This Bhakti is of two kinds; the highest and that which leads to or is instrumental to it. 

10. These five things should be known by the devotees: 
    1. The nature of th being to be worshipped. 
    2. The nature of the worshipper. 
    3. The fruit of God's grace. 
    4. The feeling of enjoyment consequent on Bhakti. 
    5. Obstruction to th attainment of God.
