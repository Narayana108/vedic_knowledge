## Dashasloki trnslated by Ramakrishna Bhandarkar on this book 游녡

1. J캶va, or the individual soul, is knowledge dependent on Hari and is is a condition to be associated with or dissociated from, a body; is an atom; different in different bodies; and is a knower and numberless.

2. The individual soul has his form distorted by its contact with m캐y캐 or prak攷뜺i, or the constituent principle with the three qualities which has no beginning. It's true nature becomes known by the grace of God. 

3. The inanimate objects are of three kinds 1* not derived by prak攷뜺i 2* derived from prak攷뜺i and 3* Time. In the thing derived by prak攷뜺i, we have the ordinary material objects having the three colors,  viz. Red, white, dark. 

4. I meditate on the highest Brahman, viz. K攷攷攷ㅡ who has eyes like a lotus, who naturally is free from all faults, is the store of all beneficient atributes, who has vy콞has for his parts, and who is adorwd by all. 

5. I reflect on the daughter of V攷攷므bh캐nu (R캐dhikam),  who shines with correspuonding beauty on the left side (of K攷攷攷ㅡ), is attended on by thousand of female friends, and who always conferes all desired objects. 

6. This Parabrahman should be always worshipped uninterruptedly by men in order to be free from the darkness in the shape of ignorance, in which they are enveloped. So was N캐rada who directely perceived the whole truth, taught by Sananda and others. 

7. All thing having Brahman for their souls in accordance with the 콐rutis and Sm攷뜺is, the knowledge that (Brahman) is all i true. 

This is the doctrine of those who know rb Vedas, and at the sam time the three forms are true as deternined from the sacred precepts (sm攷뜺is) and the S콞tras. 

8. There appears no way to salvation except the lotus-like feet of K攷攷攷ㅡ which are adored by Brahmadeva, 콐iva and others. K攷攷攷ㅡ, who at the desire of the devotee assumes a form easy of meditation and whise power is unthinkable and whose essence cannot be comprehended. 

9. His grace extends itself to those who have a feeling of helplessness and other qualifications and by that grace is generated Bhakti consisting on special love for him, who has no superior lord. 
This Bhakti is of two kinds; the highest and that which leads to or is instrumental to it. 

10. These five things should be known by the devotees: 
    1. The nature of th being to be worshipped. 
    2. The nature of the worshipper. 
    3. The fruit of God's grace. 
    4. The feeling of enjoyment consequent on Bhakti. 
    5. Obstruction to th attainment of God.
