## Sadhana (Spiritual practices)

Here are the 5 limbs of the sadhana that is performed within the tradition:

1. Karma (ritual action)

Performed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one's varna and ashrama (phase of life) thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation.

2. Vidyā (knowledge)

Not as a subordinate factor of karma, but also not as an independent means for everyone; it may be an independent means only for those inclined to spending vast lengths of time in scriptural study and reflection on deeper meanings.

3. Upāsanā or Dhyāna (meditation)

In this context it is referred to certain meditations not recommend for all.

This is again not an independent means to salvation for all, but can be to those that are qualified to perform the upasana(worship) (with Yajnopavitam) can perform this sadhana.

4. Prapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion)

Devotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna. This method of attaining salvation, known as prapatti sadhana, contains elements of all the other means, and is most importantly, available to all. Men, women, all classes and castes (or non-castes) are permitted to seek liberation through this, and is the central theme of Nimbark sadhana. It is referred to as sadhana (or apara) bhakti – devotion through regulations. This in turn leads to para bhakti(supreme devotion).

Prapatti is in no way inferior to the other methods, even though it's available to all grades and types of people.

Within prapatti **naam jap** (chanting the divine names) is the main spiritual practise to be performed.

The recommended mantra to chant for Nimbarki's is the `Yugal maha mantra` also known as the `Radha Krishna maha mantra`: 
 
```
Rādhe Kṛṣṇa Rādhe Kṛṣṇa
Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Rādhe Rādhe
Rādhe Shyām Rādhe Shyām
Shyām Shyām Rādhe Rādhe
```

All perfection can be attained through Naam Jaap (Chanting the divine names). 

```
The most important factor in this Age of Kali, which is an ocean of faults, is that one can be free from all contamination and become eligible to enter the kingdom of God simply by chanting the holy names. The self-realization that was achieved in the Satya millennium by meditation, in the Treta millennium by the performance of different sacrifices, and in the Dvapara millennium by worship of Lord Krsna can be achieved in the Age of Kali simply by chanting the holy names. - Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.51-2)
```

5. Gurupasatti (devotion and self-surrender to the Spiritual Master)

Devotion and self-surrender to Guru. Best realized as a part in Prapatti, and not as an independent means, although it can be so.
