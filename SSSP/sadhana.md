## Sadhana (Spiritual practices)

Here are the 5 limbs of the sadhana that is performed within the tradition:
1. Karma (ritual action)

Performed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one's varna and asrama (phase of life) thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation.

2. Vidyā (knowledge)

Not as a subordinate factor of karma, but also not as an independent means for everyone; it may be an independent means only for those inclined to spending vast lengths of time in scriptural study and reflection on deeper meanings.

3. Upāsanā or Dhyāna (meditation)

In this context it is referred to certain meditations not recommend for all.

This is again not an independent means to Salvation for all, but can be to those that are qualified to perform the upasana (with Yajnopavitam) can perform this Sadhana.

4. Prapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion)

Devotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna. This method of attaining Salvation, known as Prapatti Sadhana, contains elements of all the other means, and is most importantly, available to all. Men, women, all classes and castes (or non-castes) are permitted to seek liberation through this, **the most important Sadhana**. It is referred to as Sadhana (or Apara) Bhakti – devotion through regulations. This in turn leads to Para Bhakti – the highest devotion characterized by Madhurya Rasa – the sweet emotions of devotion experienced by those perfected in Sadhana Bhakti.

Prapatti is in no way inferior to the other methods, even though it's available to all grades and types of people.

Within Prapatti **Naam Jap** the chanting of Radha Krishna's names is required, and is the main sadhana.

Nimbark sampraday's maha mantra is called the `Yugal maha mantra` or `Radha Krishna maha mantra`: 
 
```
Rādhe Kṛṣṇa Rādhe Kṛṣṇa
Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Rādhe Rādhe
Rādhe Shyām Rādhe Shyām
Shyām Shyām Rādhe Rādhe
```

The most important factor in this Age of Kali, which is an ocean of faults, is that one can be free from all contamination and become eligible to enter the kingdom of God simply by chanting the holy names. The self-realization that was achieved in the Satya millennium by meditation, in the Treta millennium by the performance of different sacrifices, and in the Dvapara millennium by worship of Lord Krsna can be achieved in the Age of Kali simply by chanting the holy names. - Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.51-2)

The perfection of naam japa is roop dhyaan. This is a more advanced practise, which requires kripa(mercy) and lots of practise to be able to perform.

5. Gurupasatti (devotion and self-surrender to God as Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa)

Devotion and self-surrender to guru. Best realized as a part in Prapatti, and not as an independent means, although it can be so.
