## Svābhāvika-Dvaitādvaita Tattva

The Sutras of Maharishi Veda Vyasa form the basis of Vedanta and has a large body of sacred texts. These sutras describe different aspects of the Absolute and as a result various interpretations and schools of thought emerged, such as: Keval Advaita of Sri Sankaracharya, Visishta Advaita of Sri Ramanujacharya, Dvaita of Sri Madhavacharya, etc.  

Shri Nimbark Acharyaji established the siddhanta(philosophy) known as `Svabhavika Bhedabheda` `(Natural difference and non-difference)` or `Dvaitadvaita` `(Dualistic Non-Dualism)`.

Here is the quientessence of svābhāvika-dvaitādvaita tattva:

1. The totality of the śrutis propounding difference and non-difference are equally authoritative.

2. Difference and non-difference are both real and exist in all states of existence.

3. Brahman is the singular efficient and material cause of the universe. The example of a spider and its web is given.

4. The individual soul is an agent, enjoyer, possessed of knowership (jñātṛtvavat), plural, and infinite in number.

5. The individual soul is eternal, a portion and transformation of Brahman, and immutable.

6. The universe beginningless.

7. Liberation is attaining a similar state as Brahman.

8. Attaining Brahman in this life is called inferior liberation, which conforms to jīvanmuktī (liberation in this life). Another term for this is emancipation (apavarga). In reality it is caused by detachment from the material world. Because of not leaving the body, the individual soul cannot be absorbed into Brahman; however when the soul does eventually leave the body it enters a second type of liberation – supreme liberation, which is called attaining a similar nature as Brahman (brahmabhāvāpatti).

9. Brahman transforms into three main states: The Supreme-Soul-state, the state of the individual soul, and the state of form and formlessness (the jagat), termed ‘rāśi’.

10. Due to being the pervader and pervadable, the foundation and its dependent, having its state and actions dependent on it, mutual interdependence and other causes, difference and non-difference exists in in a singular substratum without any contradiction.

This philosophy has been able to reconcile all other schools of thought and the so called contradictory statements of the Vedas. Bhedadheda means that the jiva(individual soul) is simultaneously one and different to Brahman(Supreme soul) and to jagat/prakriti (material universe/matter).

According to Shri Nimbark Acharya, the relation between Brahman and the jiva is like a tree and its branches. The branches have all qualities of the tree, but the branches are not the tree as a whole. Likewise jiva is anu (small) having all qualities like Brahman(bibhu-large), but with limited extent. Brahman resides in the heart of jiva, but jiva has no realization due to Maya (illusion). This is the basic idea of `Dvaitadvaita` siddhanta.

While the material universe is not seen as the highest reality, it is also not seen as an illusion and is accepted as real. The jiva(individual soul) who is trapped in samsara or this lower dimention of reality which filled with all sorts of misseries needs to utilizie his/her conciousness in awakening his/her divine relation with Supreme Godhead in order to transcend this mundane reality.
