## Svābhāvika-Dvaitādvaita Tattva

The Brahma sutras constitute the central Text of Vedanta Philosophy. The Vedanta doctrines enshrined in Vedas, Upanisads, Gita, Pancharatra and Itihasa Purana are critically summarized in Brahma sutras. These Sutras enable us to get the knowledge that arises by a critical study of the entire Vedic Literature and therefore are designated as Vedanta Sutras. This indicates that the area of the source literature of Vedanta is not confined to Upanishads only but extends to the entire Veda and the allied literature.

These sutras describe different aspects of the Absolute and as a result various interpretations and schools of thought emerged, such as: Keval Advaita of Sri Sankaracharya, Visishta Advaita of Sri Ramanujacharya, Dvaita of Sri Madhavacharya, etc.

The Bhedābheda (also known by the synonym Dvaitādvaita) school of thought, which scholars suggest is the oldest philosophical understanding of Vedānta, a fact to which pre-eighth century Buddhist writings attest.

There are so different bheda abheda philosophies founded and propounded by many acharyas like Shri Bhāskara who established the Aupādhika Bhedābheda siddhanta(philosophy), Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who established the Achintya Bheda Abheda siddhanta(philosophy), etc.

Shri Nimbark Acharyaji established the svābhāvika-dvaitādvaita siddhanta(philosophy) of Bheda Abheda. 

Sanskrit word meanings:

- Svābhāvika -  Natural.
- Bhedābheda - Difference and non-difference.
- Dvaitādvaita - Dualistic Oneness.
- Tattva - principle, truth, reality.

The translations are as follows:
- Svābhāvika Bhedābheda - `Natural simultatneous difference and non-difference` 
- Svābhāvika Dvaitādvaita - `Natural simultatious dualistic oneness`


Bhedadheda tattva means that the jiva(individual soul) is simultaneously one and different to Brahman(Supreme soul) and to jagat/prakriti (material universe/matter).

This philosophy is extremely profound as it has been able to reconcile all other schools of thought and the so-called contradictory statements of the Vedas. 

Here is the essence of svābhāvika-dvaitādvaita tattva:

1. The totality of the śrutis(Vedic statements) propounding difference and non-difference are equally authoritative.

2. Difference and non-difference are both real and exist in all states of existence.

3. Brahman is the singular efficient and material cause of the universe. The example of a spider and its web is given.

4. The individual soul is an agent, enjoyer, possessed of knowership (jñātṛtvavat), plural, and infinite in number.

5. The individual soul is eternal, a portion and transformation of Brahman, and immutable.

6. The universe beginningless and real.

7. Liberation is attaining a similar state as Brahman.

8. Attaining Brahman in this life is called inferior liberation, which conforms to jīvanmuktī (liberation in this life). Another term for this is emancipation (apavarga). In reality it is caused by detachment from the material world. Because of not leaving the body, the individual soul cannot be absorbed into Brahman; however when the soul does eventually leave the body it enters a second type of liberation – supreme liberation, which is called attaining a similar nature as Brahman (brahmabhāvāpatti).

9. Brahman transforms into three main states: The Supreme-Soul-state, the state of the individual soul, and the state of form and formlessness (the jagat), termed ‘rāśi’.

10. Due to being the pervader and pervadable, the foundation and its dependent, having its state and actions dependent on it, mutual interdependence and other causes, difference and non-difference exists in a singular substratum without any contradiction.

According to Shri Nimbark Acharya, the relation between Brahman and the jiva is like a tree and its branches. The branches have all qualities of the tree, but the branches are not the tree as a whole. Likewise, the jiva is anu (small) having all qualities like Brahman(vibhu-large), but with limited extent. Brahman resides in the heart of jiva, but jiva has no realization due to Maya (illusion). This is the basic idea of `Dvaitadvaita` siddhanta.
