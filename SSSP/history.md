## Origin

The Sampraday originates from Śrī Hansa Bhagavān to Shri Sankadi Bhagavān (The Four Kumaras), who passed it to their younger brother Shri Narada Muni; and then on to Shri Nimbarka Acharya ji. 

According to tradition, Narada Muni initiated Śrī Nimbārk ācārya into the sacred 18-syllabled Śrī Gopāla Mantra, and introduced him to the philosophy of the Yugala upāsana, the devotional worship of the divine couple Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa. 

## History

The Nimbark sampraday is an ancient, mystical, lofty and deep sampraday, but most of its history starts with Shri Keshava Kashmiri Bhatta acharya and Sri Harivyas Dev acharya, as beyond these 2 acharyas, the lineage is too ancient to trace back.

The tradition has contributed great luminaries to the heritage of Bhārata. Śhrī Jayadeva Kavi (author of the famous Śhrī Gīta Govinda), members of the royal dynasties of Amer, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Merta, Udaipur, Bikaner, Kishangarh, Rupangarh, Bharatpur, Budhiya (Haryana) and others from the 16th century until Indian independence, the great Hindi poets Ghanānanda, Sundar Kuṃvarī, Bāṅkāvatī, Nāgarī Dās, etc., were all followers of monks of the Nimbārka Sampradāya. Nāgarī Dās, the spiritual name of Maharāja Sāvant Singh (born 1699), was the founding patron of the Kishangarh style of painting. Many hundreds of poems he composed after renouncing, dedicated to the Supreme Lord, are sung not only by Nimbārkīs, but also by followers of the Puṣhṭimārga (Śhrī Vallabhāchārya’s sampradāya). These are a small sample of those who credit their talents to the blessings of the Supreme Lord and the gurus of the Nimbārka Sampradāya.

Nimbārkī monks prefer to worship the Lord in seclusion. They typify the true paramahaṁsa, which is why the tradition is also known as the Paramahaṁsa Sampradāya, the lineage of the supremely renounced. Also, especially in the early days, the esoteric knowledge of Shri Radha and the Yugal maha mantra was kept secret. This lead to the sampraday slowly diminishing and towards the 15th century it was almost lost, having a very small following only. But fortunately the sampraday was revived and widespread during the 16th century by Shri Harivyas Dev acharya and his 12 main disciples.

## Branches of Shri Nimbark sampraday

There are 12 main branches or lineages from the Nimbark sampraday are originating from the 35th Acharya Shri Harivyas Dev acharya's 12 main disciples, at least 5 of these branches are still alive today. There is also one surviving lineage which is not connected to Shri Harivyas dev acharya which is the Haridas sampraday. 

The two most prominent branches today connecting to Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya are:
- `Shri Parashuramdevacharya Ji (36th)` - Initiated as the Acharya for the entire Nimbark sampraday. This lineage holds all the Nimbark sampraday acharyas for the entire sampraday.

- `Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya(36th)` - Swamiji had the largest following of the following of the disciples of Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya.

- Kathia Baba

The Kathia baba's parampara(lineage) is connected to Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya Maharaji. `Shri Indra Dasji Kathia Babaji Maharaj(50th)` was the first Nimbarki in this line to receive the title `Kathia baba`. The saints were called Kathia Baba Maharaj by the common people due to the unique thick wooden belt (kath) and white piece of cloth (kaupin) worn by them which indicated their renunciation of all bodily pleasures. Matting the hair in dreadlocks (jata) is a part of the tradition.

The Kathia baba's used to practise in seclusion in the Himalayas, but the first Kathia Baba that come down from the Himalayas and popularized this branch was `Shri Ram Das Kathia Baba(54th)`. 

### Institution  

The Nimbark sampraday operates in a decentralized manner and the temple(s) is run according to the standard and style of the present Mahant. Even though the temple(s) under a certain Mahant are independent, the Nimbark sampraday is still united within this decentralization.
