## Origin

<img src="images/nimbark/Nimbarka-7-.jpg" width=80% height=80%>

The Sampraday originates from Śrī Hansa Bhagavān to Shri Sankadi Bhagavān (The Four Kumaras), who passed it to their younger brother Shri Narada Muni; and then on to Shri Nimbarka Acharya ji. 

According to tradition, Narada Muni initiated Śrī Nimbārk ācārya into the sacred 18-syllabled Śrī Gopāla Mantra, and introduced him to the philosophy of the Yugala upāsana, the devotional worship of the divine couple Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa. 

## History

Many indologists have underlined the fact that history has not been kind to the Nimbārka Sampradāya. Nevertheless, the tradition has contributed great luminaries to the heritage of Bhārata. Śhrī Jayadeva Kavi (author of the famous Śhrī Gīta Govinda), members of the royal dynasties of Amer, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Merta, Udaipur, Bikaner, Kishangarh, Rupangarh, Bharatpur, Budhiya (Haryana) and others from the 16th century until Indian independence, the great Hindi poets Ghanānanda, Sundar Kuṃvarī, Bāṅkāvatī, Nāgarī Dās, etc., were all followers of monks of the Nimbārka Sampradāya. Nāgarī Dās, the spiritual name of Maharāja Sāvant Singh (born 1699), was the founding patron of the Kishangarh style of painting. Many hundreds of poems he composed after renouncing, dedicated to the Supreme Lord, are sung not only by Nimbārkīs, but also by followers of the Puṣhṭimārga (Śhrī Vallabhāchārya’s sampradāya). These are a small sample of those who credit their talents to the blessings of the Supreme Lord and the gurus of the Nimbārka Sampradāya.

Nimbārkī monks prefer to worship the Lord in seclusion. They typify the true paramahaṁsa, which is why the tradition is also known as the Paramahaṁsa Sampradāya, the lineage of the supremely renounced. Also especially in the early days, the esoteric knowledge of Shri Radha and the Yugal maha mantra was kept secret. This lead to the sampraday slowly diminishing and towards the 15th century it was almost lost, having a very small following only. But fortunately the sampraday was revived and widespread during the 16th century by Shri Harivyas Dev acharya and his 12 main disciples.

## Branches of Shri Nimbark sampraday

There are 12 main branches or lineages from the Nimbark sampraday are originating from the 35th Acharya Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya's 12 main disciples, maybe 5 or 6 of these branches are still alive today. There may be other branches such as Shri Haridas Sampraday, which are not connected to Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya that are still alive.

The two most promiment branches today connecting to Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya are:
- `Shri Parashuramdevacharya Ji (36th)` -  Acharya Peeth branch. 

About 35 important temples located at Vrindavan, Ajmer, Kishangad, Indore, Sholapur, Nagpur, Amravati, Nagore and Moongi paitan among other places all over india are under the tutelage of the Shri Nimbark Acharya Peeth and follow the systems and traditions of the sampraday. It also have more than a dozen of non profit instutions which consists of schools, unviversities, hostels, goshalas, libraries, printing press, medical dispensary, etc.

- `Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya(36th)` - Swamiji had the largest following of the following of the disciples of Shri Harivyas Dev Acharya.

- Kathia Baba

The Kathia baba's parampara is connected to Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya Maharaji. `Shri Indra Dasji Kathia Babaji Maharaj(50th)` the first Nimbarki in this line to receive the title `Kathia baba`

I would guess that there are more than 20 or 30 Baba temples in Vrindavan, Haridvar, Puri, Dvarka, Ashok Nagar, Guwahati, Tinsukia, Siliguri, Lona Chamiyari, Kolkatta, Madya Pradesh, Kashi, and other areas in north India. And they also have additional charity instututions such as healthcare, libraries, schools, etc.

- Other branches - They have numerous amounts of temples including large ones in different areas of North India and charity institutions.

The sampraday operates in a decentrilized manner and the temple(s) is run according to the standard and style of the present Mahant. Even though the temple(s) under a certain Mahant and are independant, the unity between all the Nimbarki's is astounding.

**Kathia baba's**

The saints were called Kathia Baba Maharaj by the common people due to the very unique thick wooden belt (kath) and white piece of cloth (kaupin) worn by them which indicated their renunciation of all bodily pleasures. Matting the hair in dreadlocks (jata) is apart of the tradition.

The Kathia baba's used to practise in seclusion in the himalays, but the first Kathia Baba that come down from the Himalayas and popularised this branch was `Shri Ram Das Kathia Baba(54th)`.
