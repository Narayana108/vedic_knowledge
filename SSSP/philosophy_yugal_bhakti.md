## Yugal Bhakti Loving devotion towards Radha Krishna

The Nimbark sampraday is a Vaishnava sampraday which also follows the pancharatra system of worship and adheres to the Vaishnava doctrine that the different forms of Radha Krishna, Sita Ram, Lakshmi Narayan, etc are supreme and that bhakti and surrender to these deities are the foundation and most important aspects of yoga.

The tradition follows the teachings of Shri Nimbark Acharya ji, other prominent acharyas within the sampraday like Shri Keshava Kashmiri Bhattacharyaji and Harivyas dev acharyaji and the philosophy of Shrimad Bhagavatam and other various other sacred texts. 

But Shri Nimbark Acharya specifically states:

```
radhaya sahito devo madhvo vaishavottamaih
archyo bandyashcha dhyeyashcha shrinimbarkapadanugaih
- Shri Nimbarka-Sudha

For the followers of Shri Nimbark Acharya they should only worship Shri Radha along with Madhava, Shri Shri Radha Rasik Bihari is the only deity which should be worshipped, which should be prayed to and upon which we should meditate. This is the only goal which is universally accepted by all. 

```

Shri Nimbark Acharya held the view that there is no superiority between Radha and Krishna, both are God (Parabrahman). 

```
Ange Tu Vame Vrishbhanujam Muda, Virajmanamnurup Saubhgaam
Sakhisahastrai Parisevitam Sada, Samrem Devim Sakaleshtkam
- Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Shri Vedanta Dashasloki (05)

The left portion of the body of the Supreme Lord is Shri Radha, seated blissfully, as beautiful as the Lord Himself; who is served by thousands of sakhis. We meditate on the Supreme Goddess, the fulfiller of all desires.
```

Even though Shri Nimbark Acharya ji was a Vaishnava and Vedantist, He has different moods and multiple spiritual identities other than being an avatar of Shri Sudarshan Chakra. His inner mood was that of sakhi bhava upasana, which is a very high level and esoteric form of worship which is not suitable for the public, this style of worship has also been maintained through the parampara up until this very present day.


```
radhaamkrsnasvaroopaam vai, krishnam raadhaasvarupinam; kalaatmaanam nikunjastham gururoopam sadaa bhaje
- Maha vani

I ceaselessly praise Radha who is none other than Krishna, and Shri Krishna who is none other than Radha, whose unity is represented by the Kaamabeeja and who are forever resident in Nikunja Goloka Vrndavana.
```

## Tilak
The tilak of the Nimbark sampraday can mean two or more things:

1. The yellow line represents a mandir, and the bindi represents the murti of Yugal Sarkar (Radha Krishna) or the yoga pÄ«tha (a mandala where Radha Krishna and the Sahecharis live). 

2. The yellow outline represents Shriji's(Radha's) charan(Lotus feet) and the black bindi between the eyebrows represents Krishna.

## Babaji vesh (Sannyasi, monkhood)
Those that accept the renounced order of life in Nimbark sampraday receive the title `babaji`. Babaji is another form sannyasi(monkhood). The dress of a babaji is white cloth (dhoti with no pleat and a shawl).

## Scriptures
The main scriptures that are focused on by general devotees and sadhus are: `Bhagavad Gita`, `Shrimad Bhagavatam` and `Bhakta Maal`. 
And the rasiks recite and focus on Yugal Kishor's(Radha Krishna's) confidential Lila books: `Yugal Satak` and `Maha Vani`.

The scholars study all the main upanishads, vedas, puranas, itihasas and Nimbarki bhasyas and other Nimbarki works that are available.
