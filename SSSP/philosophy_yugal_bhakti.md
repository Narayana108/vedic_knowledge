## Yugal Bhakti - Loving devotion towards Shri Radha Krishna

The Nimbarka Sampradaya is a Vaishnava religious tradition that follows the pancharatra system of worship and adheres to the Vaishnava doctrine that the different forms of Vishnu or Krishna, such as Radhā Kṛṣṇa, Sītā Rāma, Lakṣmī Nārāyaṇa, and others, are supreme and the best deities to be worshipped for moksha (liberation). The tradition places a great emphasis on the practice of bhakti (devotion) and the surrender of the individual self to one of these Deities, and considers bhakti to be the foundation and most important aspect of yoga. The tradition follows the teachings of Śrī Nimbārka Ācārya and other prominent acharyas, such as Śrī Keśava Kaśmīrī Bhaṭṭācārya and Harivyāsa Deva Ācārya.

But for the followers of the Shri Nimbark, their beloved deity is the divine couple, Shri Radha Krsna:

```
radhaya sahito devo madhvo vaishavottamaih
archyo bandyashcha dhyeyashcha shrinimbarkapadanugaih
- Shri Nimbarka-Sudha

For the followers of Shri Nimbark Acharya they should only worship Shri Radha along with Madhava, Shri Shri Radha Rasik Bihari is the only deity which should be worshipped, which should be prayed to and upon which we should meditate. This is the only goal which is universally accepted by all. 

```

Shri Nimbark Acharya held the view that there is no superiority between Radha and Krishna, both are God (Parabrahman). 

```
Ange Tu Vame Vrishbhanujam Muda, Virajmanamnurup Saubhgaam
Sakhisahastrai Parisevitam Sada, Samrem Devim Sakaleshtkam
- Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Shri Vedanta Dashasloki (05)

The left portion of the body of the Supreme Lord is Shri Radha, seated blissfully, as beautiful as the Lord Himself; who is served by thousands of sakhis. We meditate on the Supreme Goddess, the fulfiller of all desires.
```

Even though Shri Nimbark Acharya ji was a Vaishnava and a Vedantist, He has different moods and multiple spiritual identities other than being only being an avatar of Shri Sudarshan Chakra. He also had a sakhi svaroop(A spiritual form as a friend and maidservant of Sri Radha Krishna), this is a very high level and esoteric form of worship which is not suitable for the public, this mood of worship has also been maintained through the parampara(lineage) up until this very present day.


```
radhaamkrsnasvaroopaam vai, krishnam raadhaasvarupinam; kalaatmaanam nikunjastham gururoopam sadaa bhaje
- Maha vani(Harivyas dev acharya)

I ceaselessly praise Radha who is none other than Krishna, and Shri Krishna who is none other than Radha, whose unity is represented by the Kaamabeeja(seed mantra sound) and who are forever resident in Nikunja Vrndavana.
```

## Tilak
The tilak of the Nimbark sampraday can represent two or more things:

1. The yellow line represents a mandir(temple), and the black bindi(dot) represents the murti(deity) of Yugal Sarkar (Radha Krishna) or the yoga pītha (a mandala where Radha Krishna and the Sahecharis live).

2. The yellow outline represents Shriji's(Radha's) charan(Lotus feet) and the black bindi between the eyebrows represents Krishna.

## Babaji vesh (Saṃnyāsa/monkhood)
Those that accept the renounced order of life in Nimbark sampraday receive the title `babaji` or `svami`. Babaji is another form sannyasi(monkhood). The dress of a babaji is white cloth (dhoti with no pleat and a shawl).

## Scriptures
The main scriptures that are focused on by general devotees are: `Bhagavad Gita`, `Shrimad Bhagavatam` and `Bhakta Maal`.
And the rasiks recite and focus on Yugal Kishor's(Radha Krishna's) confidential Lila books: `Yugal Satak` and `Maha Vani`.

There are also many other wonderful books written by various acharyas. Swami Santa das Kathia Baba is one of them who wrote many divine texts in Bengali. These Sacred books cover a broad array of Vedic topics in an easy to understand manner. Fortunately some of these works have been translated to English such as: `Swami Santadas Kathamrita` and `Brahmavadin Rsis and Brahmavidya`.

The scholars study as much of the Vedic literature as possible. Which may include: Upanishads, Vedas, Puranas, Itihasas, Pancharatra Agamas and Nimbarki bhāṣya's(commentaries) and other Nimbarki sacred texts.
