## Moksha (Liberation) 

The jiva(individual soul) is covered in beginingless ignorance and is trapped in the material world, suffering all kinds of meseries such as duality, birth, death, disease, old age, etc.

Salvation is attained by real knowledge (Jnana) and true devotion (Bhakti). Real knowledge reveals the true nature of the all-pervading Brahman. True devotion leads to total self-surrender to the Lord. The individual soul retains its individuality with reference to divine enjoyment (Bhoga-samyatvam), but its will is subservient to that of Brahman. The individuality of the soul is not dissolved even in the state of Moksha or the final emancipation. Even in the state of release, the individual soul is different from, as well as identical with, Brahman. This is identity with difference, Bheda-abheda

It is released from its previous state of bondage. It abides now in the glory of its own true Self which is Brahman Itself. It is in full awareness or consciousness of being one with the Lord. It will not return to the world. It is freed from the round of births and deaths.

There are different types of liberation. Such as the jiva merging into brahman, where the jiva is in a nirguna(devoid of all characteristics and qualities) state situated in bliss or attaining an eternal spiritual body and residing in the eternal abode of vaikuntha.

### Vaishnava moksha (liberation)

1. Attaining the qualities of Shri Krishna

 The jiva(individual soul) posses the qualities of Bhagavaan, but never has the power over creation, preservation and dissolution of the world. The Jiva is also subject to being overpowerd by maya if it has not attained knowledge of Para Brahman. The difference between jiva and Bhagavaan(God) is not in kind, but in degree.

2. Residency in Vrindavan Dham

The type of liberation that is focused on within the Nimbark sampraday is to attain residency in the eternal spiritual realm called Vrindavan. 

Those who enter in this realm, go there with a new spiritual body and identity. One is in a state of awareness of full individual identity and simultatous oneness with the divine couple Shri Radha Krishna. With ones eternal spiritual body one also has a specific relationship with Radha and Krishna, such as becoming a servant, friend, parent, with Shri Yugal Sarkar(Radha Krishna) or a lover of Krishna.

One may attain liberation in this life or when one leaves ones physical body.

### How to attain Moksha (Liberation)

One attains liberation or residency only by attaining prem (divine love) for Radha and Krishna. Attaining prem (love of God) is ultimately only possible through grace. Even though grace is causeless, the devotee has to make an effort from his side as well, its works both ways. The devotee has to do his utmost best to please his Guru and follow the instuctions given in the Vedic literature and peform his daily spiritual practises. 


### Descriptions of Nitya Vrindavan

There is no such thing as illusion, old age, diseases, scarcity or envy in Vrindavan. Every single soul that resides there is a perfected being with the same nature and qualities as Shri Krishna Himself.

Even though all events happen in a sequintial manner, time does not exist in this realm and one moment could be even billions of years. 

Vrindavan dhams beauty and splendour is beyond words, everything including the inanimate objects are concious and luminous. When the gem studded golden path ways radiance blends with the reflection of the self luminous plants, it creates a holographic duplication of the plants, these holograms looks so real that the deers think they are real plants and try to eat them ! Any fruit tree can supply one with every single kind of fruit imaginable and these fruits are unlike the fruits in the material realm, they are always fresh, visually appealing, ripe, fragrant, delicious and have different kinds of flavours that we dont even know of ! There are enchanting fountains pouring out rare gems instead of water. In and around the palace where the Radha and Krishna live are peacocks, parrots, deers, flower gardens, groves, forests, the yamuna river and natural vedic architected ponds.

In Vrindavan the only goal of life is to love, serve, play and live a life centered around pleasing the divine couple. All the activities performed and ever fresh and increase with bliss, nothing including bliss is ever exhausted or reaches a saturation point.
