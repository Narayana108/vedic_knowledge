# Yuga Dharma - Japa

All the yogas are interlinked and inseparable, as by performing one yoga one or more yoga may be perfomed directly or indirectly. And when ones reaches the higher stages of yoga, it all turns into bhakti, as one who knows Krishna(God) knows everything. And the only way to know and understand Krishna in full is through bhakti.

*The Supreme Lord said: Now listen, O Arjun, how, with the mind attached exclusively to me, and surrendering to me through the practice of bhakti yog, you can know me completely, free from doubt.
I shall now reveal unto you fully this knowledge and wisdom, knowing which nothing else remains to be known in this world.
Amongst thousands of persons, hardly one strives for perfection; and amongst those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows me in truth.* - Bhagavad Gita 7.1 - 7.3

*Only by loving devotion to me does one come to know who I am in truth. Then, having come to know me, my devotee enters into full consciousness of me.* - Bhagavad Gita 18.55

It also good to note that we have different samskars therefor different attraction to different yoga's and ishta's, if we are progressing well under the guidance of a bonafide guru, we should stick to their process as there are many different ways of realization the absolute truth. 

But it is clearly stated in the Vedic Literature that Bhakti/Japa Yoga is the most effective and recommend process for self and God realization in  Kali Yuga, thats why japa is very well known as the Yuga Dharma. Here are some quotes to prove this statement.


# Sastra:

- **Kali Santrana Upanishad.** (The upanisad which helps you to clear all obstacles in Kali Yuga)

hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare
hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare

iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanaṁ
nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate

Meaning: *After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method more sublime for this age than the chanting of these sixteen names which will remove all inauspiciousness and obstacles.*


- **Manu Smriti**

*An offering, consisting of muttered prayers, is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice performed according to the rules (of the Veda); a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) a thousand times.*

*The four Pakayagnas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules (of the Veda) are all together not equal in value to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers.*

*But, undoubtedly, a Brahmana reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only; (whether) he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he who befriends (all creatures) is declared (to be) a (true) Brahmana.*


- **KulArnava Tantram**

Iswara Uvacha:
Japa Yajnath Paro Yajno NAparohastiha Kaschana ||
Tasmajjapen DharmArthaKAmaMokshanscha SAdhayeth ||

Meaning:
*In this world there is no Yajna which is superior to Japa Yajna,hence one should attain Dharma,Artha,Kama & Moksha through Japa.*

KulArnava Tantram,Chapter 15,Verse 3.


- **Brihan-naradiya Purana**

harer nama harer nama, harer namaiva kevalam;
kalau nasty eva nasty eva, nasty eva gatir anyatha.

*For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali which is full of quarrel and hypocrisy, there is  no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative to the Holy Name, the Holy  Name, the Holy Name of the Lord.* - 38.126


- **Sri Caitanya-caritamrta**

kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara
nama baite haya sarva-jagat-nistara
*In this Age of Kali, the Holy Name of the Lord, the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, is the  incarnation of Lord Krishna.  Simply by chanting the Holy Name, one associates with the  Lord directly.  Anyone who does this is certainly delivered.* - Adi-lila 17.22-26


- **Caitanya Bhagavan**
 
ataeva kali-yuga nama-yajna sara
ara kona dharma kaile nahi haya para

*Therefore the essence of all religious principles in the Age of Kali is the sacrifice of  chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra...* - Adi-khanda 14.1.39


- **Bhagavad Gita** 
 
*Of sacrifices I am the chanting of My Holy Names.* - 10.52

*Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.*- 15.19

*This is the most conﬁdential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.*- 15.20

*And of all yogīs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.* - 6.42


- **Srimad Bhagavatam**

*People in Satya-yuga are peaceful, nonenvious, friendly to every creature and steady in all situations. They worship the Supreme Personality by austere meditation and by internal and external sense control....
In Tretā-yuga, those members of human society who are fixed in religiosity and are sincerely interested in achieving the Absolute Truth worship Lord Hari, who contains within Himself all the demigods. The Lord is worshiped by the rituals of sacrifice taught in the three Vedas....
In Dvāpara-yuga men who desire to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer, worship Him in the mood of honoring a great king, following the prescriptions of both the Vedas and tantras....
Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value of this Age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of saṅkīrtana [chanting together]*. - 11.5.22,36

puṁsāṁ kali-kṛtān doṣān
dravya-deśātma-sambhavān
sarvān harati citta-stho
bhagavān puruṣottamaḥ

*In the Kali-yuga, objects, places and even individual personalities are all polluted. The almighty Personality of Godhead, however, can remove all such contamination from the life of one who fixes the Lord within his mind. If a person hears about, glorifies, meditates upon, worships or simply offers great respect to the Supreme Lord, who is situated within the heart, the Lord will remove from his mind the contamination accumulated during many thousands of lifetimes.... Whatever result was obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Viṣṇu, in Tretā-yuga by performing sacrifices, and in Dvāpara-yuga by serving the Lord’s lotus feet can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by chanting [Hari].* - 12.3.45

kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet

*My dear King, although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.* - 12.3.51

kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt

*Whatever result was obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Viṣṇu, in Tretā-yuga by performing sacrifices, and in Dvāpara-yuga by serving the Lord’s lotus feet can be obtained in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.* - 12.3.52


- **Vishnu Purana**

dhyayan krte yajan yajnais
tretayam dvapare 'rcayan
yad apnoti tad apnoti
kalau sankirtya kesavam

*The fruit of penance, of continence, of silent prayer, and the like, practised in the Krita age for ten years, in the Treta for one year, in the Dwápara for a month, is obtained in the Kali age in a day and night: therefore did I exclaim "Excellent, excellent, is the Kali age!" That reward which a man obtains in the Krita by abstract meditation, in the Treta by sacrifice, in the Dwápara by adoration, he receives in the Kali by merely reciting the name of Keshava.*


- **Padma Purana**

dvapariyair janair visnuh
pancaratrais tu kevalaih
kalau tu nama-matrena
pujyate bhagavan harih
 
*Whatever is achieved by meditation in Satya-yuga, by the performance of yajna in  Treta-yuga or by the worship of Krishna's lotus feet in Dvapara-yuga is obtained very  easily in the Age of Kali simply by chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.* - Uttara-khanda 72.25


# Sadhu:
Here are some statements from fully self realized souls and avatars.

- **Swami Shivananda**
  - Japa Japa Japa the only way to wipe out your all sufferings and sins.
  - In this Iron Age, Japa Yoga is an easy way for attaining God-realisation

https://gurudevsivananda.blogspot.com/2010/11/japa-yoga-by-gurudev-swami-sivananda.html


- **Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj**

*It is impossible to attain God by practicing austerities, yoga, japa or by jnana and renunciation. He can only be attained by exclusive devotion.*


- **SwamiNarayan**

A very recent incarnation of Narayana. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminarayan

"While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered Astanga yoga (eightfold yoga) in a span of nine months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi."
![SwamiNarayan!](https://kids.baps.org/storytime/photo/gopalyogi.jpg)
![SwamiNarayan Ashtanga!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/49/a4/1849a4149c326cd3833af8733b2b65bb.jpg)

^ That happend before he was 18, But still he only taught Japa and bhakti even to his most advanced disciples and they all reached maha samadi and prem.

*This magnificent gift
is the Swaminarayan mahamantra
(supreme mantra) and was bestowed
unto mankind about 213 years ago
by Bhagwan Swaminarayan.
In explaining the glory of the Swaminarayan mahamantra,
Gunatitanand Swami said, “All malicious desires, bad habits,
and addictions will be eradicated. Any sins or mistakes that
have been committed, knowingly or unknowingly, will be
washed away. Even if someone is bitten by a venomous snake,
the poison is incapable of causing any harm. Such is the
strength of the supreme Swaminarayan mahamantra.”*
(Swami Ni Vaato – P.1, V.153)


- **Rama Krishna**

*However it would be far more profitable if one chants the name of God with
faith, love and longing. Sri Ramakrishna emphasizes intense yearning:
Goswami: "Sir, the chanting of God's name is enough. The scriptures
emphasize the sanctity of God's name for the Kaliyuga."
Master: "Yes, there is no doubt about the sanctity of God's name. But can a
mere name achieve anything, without the yearning love of the devotee behind it?
One should feel great restlessness of soul for the vision of God. Suppose a man
repeats the name of God mechanically, while his mind is absorbed in `lust and gold',
can he achieve anything?
"Therefore I say, chant the name of God, and with it pray to Him that you
may have love for Him. Pray to God that your attachment to such transitory things
as wealth, name, and creature comforts may become less and less every day."
The scriptures and saints tell us that there is a tremendous joy in God's name,
for God is of the nature of Bliss; He is Satchidananda. A beginner, however, does not
experience any joy. On the contrary he may feel only dryness. It is not the fault of
God's name. The fault lies in the mind of the devotee. As long as the mind has not
turned away from worldly delights it is not possible to taste divine bliss. One must
try to develop discrimination and dispassion for the world. Only when the mind is
purified of worldly dross does one begin to taste the joy of divine name. One must
pray to God with yearning for getting rid of desires and for getting delight in His
name:
Devotee: "How can I take delight in God's name?"
Master: "Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name.
He will certainly fulfil your heart's desire."*


- **Swami Vivekananda**

*Books and learning, Yoga and meditation and illumination — all are but dust compared with love.*


- **Tulsi Das**

*The age of Kali is a store house of impurities and vices but it has many virtues too. Final emancipation is possible in the Kali age without any exertion. Moreover, the same goal which is reached through worship of God, performance of sacrifices or the practice of Yoga in the Satyayuga and in the Treta and Dwapara yuga, men are able to attain through the name of Sri Hari in the Kali age. No other age can compare with the Kali age provided a man has faith (in its virtue); for in this age one can easily cross the ocean of transmigration simply by singing Sri Ram's holy praises.*
https://tulsidasa.blogspot.com/2016/06/kali-yuga.html


- **Guru Nanak**

*With my hands I do God's work; with my tongue I sing God's Glorious Praises.
With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master.
It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
With your eyes, behold the Blessed Vision of the Saints.
Record the Immortal Lord God within your mind.
Listen to the Kirtan of God's Praises, at the Feet of the Holy.
Your fears of birth and death shall depart.
Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within your heart.
Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall be redeemed.*
— Guru Granth Sahib, page 189


Sri Ramanuja Acarja, Nimbark Acarya, Vallabha Acharya, Madhav Acarya, Sri Krsna Caitanya, etc all recommend and bhakti and japa as the most effective yoga for Kali Yuga as well As this is all the teachings in the vedas.
